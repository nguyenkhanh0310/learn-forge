     * Gets a signed URL to upload an object directly to S3, bypassing OSS servers. You can also request an array of signed URLs which lets you upload an object in chunks.  This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the upload before the signed URL expires. The upload itself can take longer. If the upload fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL (or an array of signed URLs as the case may be). However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation.   Only applications that own the bucket can call this operation.  **Note:** Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even when using a single signed URL.   In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

     * @param {string} objectKey The URL-encoded human friendly name of the object.
     * @param {string} [ifNoneMatch] The last known ETag value of the object. OSS returns the signed URL only if the &#x60;&#x60;If-None-Match&#x60;&#x60; header differs from the ETag value of the object on S3. If not, it returns a 304 \&quot;Not Modified\&quot; HTTP status.
     * @param {string} [ifModifiedSince] A timestamp in the HTTP date format (Mon, DD Month YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT). The signed URL is returned only if the object has been modified since the specified timestamp. If not, a 304 (Not Modified) HTTP status is returned.
     * @param {string} [xAdsAcmScopes] Optional OSS-compliant scope reference to increase bucket search performance
     * @param {string} [responseContentType] The value of the Content-Type header you want to receive when you download the object using the signed URL. If you do not specify a value, the Content-Type header defaults to the value stored with OSS.
     * @param {string} [responseContentDisposition] The value of the Content-Disposition header you want to receive when you download the object using the signed URL. If you do not specify a value, the Content-Disposition header defaults to the value stored with OSS.
     * @param {string} [responseCacheControl] The value of the Cache-Control header you want to receive when you download the object using the signed URL. If you do not specify a value, the Cache-Control header defaults to the value stored with OSS.
     * @param {boolean} [publicResourceFallback] Specifies how to return the signed URLs, in case the object was uploaded in chunks, and assembling of chunks is not yet complete.  - &#x60;&#x60;true&#x60;&#x60; : Return a single signed OSS URL. - &#x60;&#x60;false&#x60;&#x60; : (Default) Return multiple signed S3 URLs, where each URL points to a chunk.
     * @param {number} [minutesExpiration] The time window (in minutes) the signed URL will remain usable. Acceptable values &#x3D; 1-60 minutes. Default &#x3D; 2 minutes.  **Tip:** Use the smallest possible time window to minimize exposure of the signed URL.
     * @param {boolean} [useCdn] &#x60;&#x60;true&#x60;&#x60; : Returns a URL that points to a CloudFront edge location.  &#x60;&#x60;false&#x60;&#x60; : (Default) Returns a URL that points directly to the S3 object.
     * @param {boolean} [redirect] Generates a HTTP redirection response (Temporary Redirect 307​) using the generated URL.
     * @param accessToken bearer access token
     * @param {*} [options] Override http request option.

    /**
     * Gets a signed URL to upload an object directly to S3, bypassing OSS servers. You can also request an array of signed URLs which lets you upload an object in chunks.  This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the upload before the signed URL expires. The upload itself can take longer. If the upload fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL (or an array of signed URLs as the case may be). However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation.   Only applications that own the bucket can call this operation.  **Note:** Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even when using a single signed URL.   In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

     * @param {number} [parts] The number of parts you intend to chunk the object for uploading. OSS will return that many signed URLs, one URL for each chunk. If you do not specify a value you\&#39;ll get only one URL to upload the entire object.
     * @param {number} [firstPart] The index of the first chunk to be uploaded.
     * @param {string} [uploadKey] The &#x60;&#x60;uploadKey&#x60;&#x60; of a previously-initiated upload, in order to request more chunk upload URLs for the same upload. If you do not specify a value, OSS will initiate a new upload entirely.
