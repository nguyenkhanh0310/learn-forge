It contains information such as the URNs of the derivatives, the translation status of each derivative, and much more.  The first time you translate a source design, the Model Derivative service creates a manifest for that design. Thereafter, every time you translate that source design, even to a different format, the Model Derivative service updates the same manifest. It does not create a new manifest. Instead, the manifest acts like a central registry for all the derivatives of your source design created through the Model Derivative service.    When the Model Derivative service starts a translation job (as a result of a request you make using `Create Translation Job </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/jobs/job-POST/>`_), it keeps on updating the manifest at regular intervals. So, you can use the manifest to check the status and progress of each derivative that is being generated. When multiple derivatives have been requested each derivative may complete at a different time. So, each derivative has its own ``status`` attribute. The manifest also contains an overall ``status`` attribute. The overall ``status`` becomes ``complete`` when the ``status`` of all individual derivatives become complete.  Once the translation status of a derivative is ``complete`` you can download the derivative.  **Note:** You cannot download 3D SVF2 derivatives.
